# sharp-commands

## todo
* automatic help for commands
* flag not found validation
* flags with basic value (string only)
* flags with typeof(T) value (special handling of bool and array types needs implementing)
* support better ICommand interface for commands that are more like namespaces (have no actions but contain nested commands)
